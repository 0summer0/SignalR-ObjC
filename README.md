# SignalR 
Async signaling library for Objective C to help build real-time, multi-user interactive web applications

## What can it be used for?
Pushing data from the server to the client (not just browser clients) has always been a tough problem. SignalR makes 
it dead easy and handles all the heavy lifting for you.
